The Contagion of Neurologic Immersion Predicts Retail Purchases.

Imagine when you're completely absorbed and captivated by an experience, whether it's a movie, a book, or an event. In a similar way, we wanted to measure how engaged customers were while shopping. That would help understand 'what makes a great customer service experience, and how can Immersion help retailers create a real differentiator for the in-store experience?'

To do this, we looked at signals from the brain that indicate attention and emotional resonance – essentially, how much the brain values a social experience. This concept is what we called 'Immersion.' Think of it as a measure of how 'into' something a person is – how focused and emotionally connected they are. Now, 'peak immersion' is like the moment when they're most captivated by what's happening around them.

The challenge was that we had a relatively small dataset to work with. To overcome this, I employed R to generate new data, effectively expanding the dataset's scale while preserving its authenticity. This allowed us to uncover meaningful insights even with limited information.

I combined the strengths of multiple machine learning models to successfully predicting customer purchases after controlling for factors like customer time in the store and loyalty, Immersion emerged as a stronger predictor, achieving a remarkable 72% accuracy.
